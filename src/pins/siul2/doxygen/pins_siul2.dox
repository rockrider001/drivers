@defgroup pins Pins Driver (PINS)
@brief The S32 SDK provides Peripheral Drivers for the PINS module of MPC574xx, S32Rx7x and S32V234 devices.
@details The module provides dedicated pad control to general-purpose pads that can be
configured as either inputs or outputs. The PINS module provides registers that enable
user software to read values from GPIO pads configured as inputs, and write values to
GPIO pads configured as outputs:
- When configured as output, you can write to an internal register to control the state
driven on the associated output pad.
- When configured as input, you can detect the state of the associated pad by reading
the value from an internal register.
- When configured as input and output, the pad value can be read back, which can be
used as a method of checking if the written value appeared on the pad.

The PINS supports these following features:
For MPC574xx, S32Rx7x and S32V234 devices: Pins driver is based on SIUL2 (System Integration Unit Lite2) module
* The System Integration Unit Lite2 supports these distinctive features:
- 1 to 32 GPIO ports with data control
- Drive data to as many as 16 independent I/O channels
- Sample data from as many as 16 independent I/O channels
* Two 16-bit registers can be read/written with one access for a 32-bit port, if needed.
* External interrupt/DMA request support with:
- 1 to 4 system interrupt vectors for 1 to 4 interrupt sources with independent interrupt
masks. For 32 external interrupt sources (REQ pins), four groups have eight interrupt
sources each, and each of the four groups is assigned one system interrupt vector.
- 1 to 32 programmable digital glitch filters, one for each REQ pin
- 1 to 4 system DMA request channels for 1 to 4 REQ pins
- Edge detection
* Additionally the SIUL2 contains the Multiplexed Signal Configuration Registers
(MSCR) that configure the electrical parameters and settings for as many as 512
functional pads. The number of these registers that is actually implemented varies by
device. These registers configure the following pad features:
- Drive strength
- Output impedance control
- Open drain/source output enable
- Slew rate control
- Hysteresis control
- Internal pull control and pull selection
- Pin function assignment
- Control of analog path switches
- Safe mode behavior configuration
- DDR input
